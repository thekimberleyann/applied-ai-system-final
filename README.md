# VibeFinder — Music Recommender Simulation

A simple content-based music recommender. It scores each song in a catalog against
a user's "taste profile" (favorite genre, mood, target energy) and returns a ranked,
explained list of suggestions.

## How The System Works

### What a recommender does

A recommender system suggests items a person is likely to enjoy. Streaming
services like Spotify and Netflix do this constantly: out of a huge library,
they surface the handful of songs or shows most relevant to you. VibeFinder is
a small, transparent version of the same idea, built for a fixed catalog of
songs.

### Two common approaches

Real-world recommenders are usually built one of two ways.

- **Collaborative filtering** learns from the behavior of many users. It looks
  at what large numbers of people liked, skipped, replayed, or added to
  playlists, and finds patterns across those users. The core idea is "people
  who behaved like you also enjoyed this." For example, Spotify's Discover
  Weekly can recommend a track simply because listeners with taste similar to
  yours keep saving it, even without knowing anything about how the song
  sounds. This approach needs a large history of user interactions to work.
- **Content-based filtering** matches the features of the items themselves to a
  user's stated preferences. It does not need other users at all. The core idea
  is "this item's attributes line up with what you said you want." For example,
  you tell a service you like calm acoustic music, and it scores each song by
  how well its genre, mood, and energy fit that description. This approach needs
  good item features and a clear preference to compare against.

### Which approach VibeFinder uses, and why

VibeFinder uses **content-based filtering**.

This is a deliberate choice forced by the data we have. VibeFinder has no record
of how anyone has ever listened -- there are no likes, skips, play counts,
ratings, or playlists to learn from. Collaborative filtering is therefore not
possible here, because there is no crowd of user behavior to find patterns in.
What VibeFinder does have is a catalog where every song is described by concrete
features, plus a single user's stated taste profile. It compares the two
directly: for each song it measures how well the song's features match the
profile, produces a score, ranks the songs by that score, and returns a short
list of the best matches with a plain-language reason for each.

### Song features (what VibeFinder knows about each song)

Each song in the catalog is described by these features:

- **title** -- the song's name.
- **artist** -- the performer.
- **genre** -- the musical category (for example pop, rock, lofi, jazz).
- **mood** -- the emotional feel (for example happy, chill, intense, calm).
- **energy** -- how energetic the track is, on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale, where higher
  means more energetic.
- **tempo_bpm** -- the tempo in beats per minute (a whole number).

### UserProfile features (what VibeFinder knows about you)

A user's taste profile has three preferences, which songs are matched against:

- **favorite_genre** -- the genre the listener most wants to hear.
- **favorite_mood** -- the mood the listener is in the mood for.
- **target_energy** -- the listener's preferred energy level, on the same 0.0
  to 1.0 scale as a song's energy.
